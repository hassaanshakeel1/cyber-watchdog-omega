🛠️ Key Features
Heuristic Threat Detection: Proactively identifies indicators of ransomware and malicious code patterns.

Plagiarism Analysis: Calculates precise similarity scores between two files to detect content theft or code duplication.

3D HTML Reporting: Automatically generates a professional, high-fidelity interactive forensic report viewable in any modern web browser.

Entropy Depth Mapping: Analyzes file zones (Header, Code, Data, and Overlay) to detect hidden packers or encrypted payloads.

💻 Getting Started
1. Compilation
Use a C++ compiler (such as G++) to build the executable:

2. Execution
Run the tool from your terminal and provide the requested file paths:

3. Review Results
Once the scan is complete, open the generated forensic report in your browser:
